# Pegasus
Pegasus is a Rust IDE. It's named after concatenating R from rust and IDE into ride and picking something familiar from greek mythology that is easily typeable and pronouncable. A winged white stallion should also be pretty easily to make logos and icons for.

The project aim is to implement as much of it in C++ and then port it to rust when it stabilizes.
