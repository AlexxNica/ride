Ride is a [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). It's named after concatenating R from rust and IDE. It's currently not in a usable state.
If you're looking for something more complete, perhaps [RustDT](http://rustdt.github.io/) for Eclipse or [SolidOak](https://github.com/oakes/SolidOak) is your thing.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/madeso/ride.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/madeso/ride)

The current features are:

* A pretty ok editor (scintilla based)
* Shortcuts for running various cargo commands
* Listing its output and
	- Double clicking on warnings/errors to go to them.
	- Context clicking on warnings/errors to google them.
* A basic project/cargo (file) explorer
* Space/tab settings are saved per project so the same settings are used by everyone on the project
* Autocompile protobuf files

The project aim is to implement as much of it in C++ and then port it to rust when wxWidgets for rust is available.

Some of the development is streamed [on twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/imadesome) and later uploaded [to youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLZf3o2GDQ_hHiXd_xqL_ShzGcU44WMi3).

# Getting ride
This isn't finished. Eventually there should be a installer here, but that isn't finished. [Issue #13](https://github.com/madeso/ride/issues/13) is looking to fix this. If you want to try it, you need to download the source and build it yourself.

# Building ride
You need CMake, a C++ compiler, protobuf and wxWidgets 3+. Doxygen, Python 2, clang-format and cppcheck are optional and can be disabled via the CMake BUILD_USE_ variables. To actually build it, it is pretty standard. Use CMake to generate a configuration and then build that configuration.

## wxWidgets 3.x
Currently the wxWidgets used is a fork from the public wxWidgets master. [Issue #16](https://github.com/madeso/ride/issues/16) is looking to fix this. The public download of wxWidgets 3.0 or the public master can be used but then the CMake variables USE_CPP_AS_RUST use WX_WIDGETS_LEGACY_FINDTEXT has to be changed to true.
